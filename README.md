# University Admission Prediction Model

## Project Description

This project aims to develop a model that predicts the likelihood of students being admitted to master's programs based on several important parameters. The project includes data analysis (EDA) and multiple linear regression modeling.

## Dataset

The dataset contains several parameters considered important for applying to master's programs. The parameters included are:

- **GRE Scores:** (out of 340) The score obtained in the GRE exam.
- **TOEFL Scores:** (out of 120) The score obtained in the TOEFL exam.
- **University Rating:** (out of 5) The overall rating of the university.
- **Statement of Purpose and Letter of Recommendation Strength:** (out of 5) The strength of the statement of purpose and recommendation letters.
- **Undergraduate GPA:** (out of 10) The GPA from the undergraduate degree.
- **Research Experience:** (either 0 or 1) Whether the student has research experience.
- **Chance of Admit:** (ranging from 0 to 1) The probability of admission.

## Data Analysis and Modeling

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analysis of the data to understand the distribution and relationships of features. This includes data cleaning, handling missing values, and computing basic statistics.

2. **Feature Selection and Preprocessing:** Selection of relevant features and preprocessing of the data to improve model performance.

3. **Modeling:** Development of a multiple linear regression model to predict the chance of admission. The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
